        We take our environmental duties very seriously here at Quiz Dog. Between answer sheets and ink for picture rounds, the carbon footprint of a quiz can expand to those sasquatch prints in the snow.
        We decided to make a difference and put everything online. No easy task given the access to Google, but with our anti-cheating measures, we are confident we have the greenest events company on the market. We are always looking for ways in which we can go even further with lessening our environmental impact and are striving for complete carbon neutrality.

        One of the ways in which we are doing our bit for mother earth is by promising to plant a tree for every corporate client we have playing the quiz. This is done in partnership with the amazing people over at Ecologi (a B-Corps certificate company).
