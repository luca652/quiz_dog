      Above everything here at Quiz Dog, the thing we are most proud of is our
      amazing team of passionate Quizmasters. However, we understand that
      margins are tight at the minute and sometimes cost cutting is not preferred,
      but a necessity. Well, we have you covered.

      Our quizmasters are an array of comedians, actors, and broadcasters that
      know how to work a crowd. When we provide a venue with a quizmaster,
      they’re in for the long haul. We think it’s so important for there to be a
      great rapport between venue, performer, and audience. If for some reason
      the quizmaster can’t make it, don’t despair! Quiz Dog has a team of
      dedicated and experienced <%= link_to "professionals", about_us_path(anchor: 'our-team') %> that are more than happy to step in.

      A Quiz Dog quiz is written and performed with each location in mind. No two
      venues are the same, and here at Quiz Dog we want to guarantee that your
      venue’s event is the best event it’s possible to have. With this in mind, our
      quizzes are flexible. If you want bonus rounds, we have them ready. If you
      want a shorter quiz, no problem. We work closely with each venue to
      guarantee the perfect event for your venue.
    </p>
    <p class="empty-line"></p>
    <p>
      On average, a quiz lasts two hours, and we’re always mindful that our events
      are usually on school nights.

        “We've been using QuizDog in our taproom once a week
        for over a year, and we've grown Thursday revenues into
        something that nearly matches our weekend numbers. If
        you're a business owner, you know that's amazing!
        QuizDog makes it fun and easy to put on a weekly quiz in
        your pub, whether you host it yourself, like me, or you
        pass hosting duties onto someone else on your staff.
